# Environmental_Project

This project will be a continuation of the work begun as the final project in my Data Analysis bootcamp.  Our group project focused on assessing the relationship between a country's greenhouse gas emissions and their economic output over time.  Over the course of working on that project with my group, I had some ideas I was not able to explore under the time contraints of class. This repo is my personal attempt to re-examine some of the data we found, and to perhaps branch off in a different direction.  Stay tuned for more!
